    "readme": "# jupyter_bokeh\n\nA Jupyter extension for rendering Bokeh content.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Jupyter Lab or Notebook\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the latest version in Jupyter Lab:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c bokeh jupyter_bokeh\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\njupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh\n```\n\nTo install a specific version:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh@x.y.x\n```\n\nOn slow or limited memory systems, one can use `--minimize=False` to reduce compilation\ntimes or make Jupyter Lab build runtime bundles at all.\n\njupyter_bokeh is automatically installed in Jupyter Notebook. In case of a non-standard\nsetup, one can install the extensions with:\n\n```bash\njupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --py jupyter_bokeh\njupyter nbextension enable jupyter_bokeh --py --sys-prefix\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe core [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) library is generally version independent of\n[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and this ``jupyter_bokeh`` extension\nfor versions of ``bokeh>=2.0.0``.\n\nOur goal is that ``jupyter_bokeh`` minor releases (using the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) pattern) are\nmade to follow JupyterLab minor release bumps and micro releases are for new ``jupyter_bokeh`` features\nor bug fix releases. We've been previously inconsistent with having the extension release minor version bumps\ntrack that of JupyterLab, so users seeking to find extension releases that are compatible with their JupyterLab\ninstallation may refer to the below table.\n\n###### Compatible JupyterLab and `jupyter_bokeh` versions\n\n| JupyterLab    | `jupyter_bokeh`  |\n| ------------- | ---------------- |\n| 0.34.x        | 0.6.2            |\n| 0.35.x        | 0.6.3            |\n| 1.0.x         | 1.0.0            |\n| 2.0.x         | 1.0.0            |\n\n## Development\n\nFor a development install (requires npm version 6 or later), do the following in the repository directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\njupyter labextension link .\n```\n\nTo rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\njupyter lab build\n```\n\nTo incrementally rebuild the extension and JupyterLab after changes you can run\n\n```bash\nnpm run watch\n```\n\nand in another terminal run\n\n```bash\njupyter lab --watch\n```\n\nWhen making a new release for compatibility with a new JupyterLab minor release series, please make a minor\nrelease bump in this extension (i.e. 0.6.3 -> 0.7.0). Conversely, when creating a release for a new feature or bug fix,\nplease make a micro release bump (i.e. 0.6.3 -> 0.6.4).\n\n## Testing\n\nThere is a directory named ``examples`` which contains a collection of notebooks that cover the various ``jupyter_bokeh``\nfunctionalities. If you update the extension for new JupyterLab releases, please manually execute each and check that the\nexpected behavior occurs. If you extend the ``jupyter_bokeh``, please add a new notebook that covers the new functionality.\n",
