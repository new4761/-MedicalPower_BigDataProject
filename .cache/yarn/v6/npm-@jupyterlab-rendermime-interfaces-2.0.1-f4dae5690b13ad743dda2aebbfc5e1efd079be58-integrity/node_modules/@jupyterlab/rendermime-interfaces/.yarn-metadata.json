    "readme": "# @jupyterlab/rendermime-interfaces\n\nA package for JupyterLab which provides interfaces for implementing mime renderer extensions.\n\nA general JupyterLab plugin involves a certain amount of boilerplate code\nthat can be annoying for authors of relatively extensions.\nThe interfaces in this package are meant to give an easier way for extension authors\nto provide a plugin that renders mime bundles and documents of a specific mime type.\n\nWhen using these interfaces, extensions only need to provide some metadata about\nwht kind of mime bundle they are able to render, and a `Widget` with\na `renderModel` method that renders the mime bundle.\n\nExamples can be found in [@jupyterlab/vega5-extension](../vega5-extension) and [@jupyterlab/pdf-extension](../pdf-extension).\n",
